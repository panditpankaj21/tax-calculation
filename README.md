## Setup

If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.

[Download the ZIP from this location](https://github.com/panditpankaj21/tax-calculation/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), or run the following git command to clone the files to your machine:

```bash
git repo clone panditpankaj21/tax-calculation
```

- Once the files are on your machine, open the tax-calculatioin folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- With the files open in Visual Studio Code, press the **Go Live** button at the bottom of the window to launch the files with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
